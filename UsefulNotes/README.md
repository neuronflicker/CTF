# Useful Notes for CTF
This area is intended to give a list of useful notes, tool, hints and tips that we have come across while learning about and doing Capture the Flag challenges.

These will be split into sections by type of challenge, and may be split further into sub-pages about specifics if the category pages get too long, or a separate section seems sensible.
