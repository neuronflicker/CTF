**Description:**

This flag is hidden in a readme

We will only guide those who want to learn on this one

**This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format**

## Write-up
If you read the [Guide page](https://ctf.brixel.space/guide) on the Brixel CTF site, the final sentence read: `Enter 'freepoints' without the quotes in the readme challenge to claim them. Spend them well.`

This gave us the flag.
