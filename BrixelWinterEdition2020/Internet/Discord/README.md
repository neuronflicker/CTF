**Description:**
Join our Discord and read the rules.

## Write-up
This was a simple solve - just join the Discord server and read the rules. The rules were:
````
1: Enjoy yourself and don't take it too seriously.
2: No attacking the CTF server and all of CTF related servers
3: No spamming, flaming, or otherwise bad behaviour on the discord
4: Collaboration between competing teams is not allowed.
5: Reading the rules gets you this flag: <flag was here>
6: Flag hoarding and/or breaking challenges so no-one else can play them is not allowed.
7: Decision taken by admins in the CTF regarding all disputes is final.
8: The maximum of tries will not be reset, ask help if needed or talk to me if you are certain you are entering the correct flag.


How do I get help?
1. Feel free to tag the challenge organizers and admins if you face any issues in the #help channel
2. If you face an issue, post a screenshot along with it.
3. Be patient! We might be in different time zones.
```
Rule 5 gave us the flag.
