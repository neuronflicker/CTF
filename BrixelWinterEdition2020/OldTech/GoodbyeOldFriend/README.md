## Write-up
The attachment for this challenge was an SWF (or Adobe Flash) file. To view this we opened it in Internet Explorer. It played some music while scrolling some text up and down the screen. Unfotunately, no screen grab was taken at the time, and Flash no longer works, so it can't be shown here.

While the Flash file was running, we noticed a letter 'f'. Resizing the Image Explorer window brings more of this text into view. After a lot of resizing to the right aspect ratio, we could see the full message and this gave use the flag.
