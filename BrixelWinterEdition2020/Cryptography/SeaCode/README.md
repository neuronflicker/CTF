## Write-up
The *wav* file was downloaded from the challenge. When listening to it, it sounded like Morse Code.

Searching [Google](https://www.google.com) for a Morse Code decoder, I found one at [Morse Code World](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html).

Uploading the *wav* file and hitting play, the message "THE FLAG FOR THIS CHALLENGE IS &lt;flag was here&gt;" was displayed letter by letter.
