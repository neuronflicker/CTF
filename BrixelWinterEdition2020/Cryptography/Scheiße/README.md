**Description:**

A german messenger was caught during WW2

He was carrying a piece of paper that read: qbhbh zrmua gfbld ocqbv

He was nice enough to give us all we wanted, except the decoded message, he needs a special machine for that, and we don't have it.

He DID give us the settings for the machine.

The settings for this machine are:

Model: G-312

Reflector: UKW 11/26

Rotor 1: 2/12/6

Rotor 2: 1/17/16

Rotor 3: 3/12/1

The flag is ONE word, no spaces. do NOT translate the flag!

**This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format**
