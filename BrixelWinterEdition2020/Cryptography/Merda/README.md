**Description:**

An Italian messenger was caught during the war

He was carrying a piece of paper that read: ymj kqfl nx gwncjqHYK{uneefsfutqn}

Upon torturing the messenger for an explaination, he gestured a V with his fingers. The english guard took it as an insult and killed him right on the spot.

Maybe he just wanted some peace?
