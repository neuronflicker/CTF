# A Quick Search
**Category:** [OSINT](../README.md)

**Points:** 5

**Description:**

Here's an easy one to start off the OSINT challenges.

I took this photo but forgot the name of this tower.

Can you give me the name?

I remember it started with an E.

**This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{fl-ag} format**

## Write-up
The solution was simply a reverse image search for this image:

<image src="image.jpg" alt="Image of tower" width="200" />

We went to [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp), clicked on the little camera icon in the search box, and uploaded the image that was downloaded from the challenge.

The search result gives the name of the tower.

> Note: When entering the flag, don't include the word Tower!
