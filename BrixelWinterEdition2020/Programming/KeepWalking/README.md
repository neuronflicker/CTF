**Description:**

This is a challenge to test your basic programming skills.


Pseudo code:

Set X = 1

Set Y = 1

Set previous answer = 1


answer = X * Y + previous answer + 3


After that => X + 1 and Y + 1 ('answer' becomes 'previous answer') and repeat this till you have X = 525.


The final answer is the value of 'answer' when X = 525. Fill it in below.


Example:

5 = 1 * 1 + 1 + 3

12 = 2 * 2 + 5 + 3

24 = 3 * 3 + 12 + 3
